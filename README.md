This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when accessing elements of a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an element beyond the vector's bounds.  This can cause unpredictable program behavior, from crashes to silent data corruption. The solution modifies the loop condition to prevent out-of-bounds access. This simple example highlights the importance of careful loop boundary checks in C++ programming to avoid common errors.
